  %h2 How to install
  %p
    Installing gobot with arduino support is pretty easy using ruby gems.
  :markdown
        :::bash
        gem install gobot-crazyflie

  %h2 How to use
  %p
    This small program causes the Crazyflie to 'hop' up in the air for 1 second.
  :markdown
        :::go
        require 'gobot'

        connection :crazyflie, :adaptor => :crazyflie
        device :drone, :driver => :crazyflie, :connection => :crazyflie, :interval => 0.1

        work do
          drone.forward(0)
          drone.set_thrust_on
          after(1.seconds) {drone.stop}
        end

  %h2 How to connect
  %p
    The Crazyflie uses a 2.4 GHz radio to communicate. There is a
    USB dongle called the Crazyradio that is required to control the Crazyflie quadcopter.
  %p
    If you are have a USB 3.0 port, you might run into this issue

  %h2 How to hover
  %p
    To use Crazyflie with the hover command, requires installing the 
    %a{ href:"https://bitbucket.org/omwdunkley/crazyflie-firmware" } https://bitbucket.org/omwdunkley/crazyflie-firmware
    fork of the Crazyflie firmware. The easiest way to currently do this, is to 
    install the Crazyflie PC Client, download the 'hover' branch BIN file from here 
    %a{ href:"https://bitbucket.org/omwdunkley/crazyflie-firmware/downloads/cflie.bin" } https://bitbucket.org/omwdunkley/crazyflie-firmware/downloads/cflie.bin
    and then use the Crazyflie PC tools to update the Crazyflie firmware.

  %p
    Once you have updated the Crazyflie firmware, you will NEED to use the following syntax in your gobot code to use it:

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        connection :crazyflie, :adaptor => :crazyflie, :supports_hover => true

  %p
    If you do not add :supports_hover => true to your connection code to the Crazyflie, it will go crazy out of control as you as you try to connect to it. You have been warned... 

%section.drivers
  %h2 Drivers
