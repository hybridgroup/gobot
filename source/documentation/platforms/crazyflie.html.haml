  %section.how_to
    %h2 How to install
    %p
      Installing Cylon.js with arduino support is pretty easy using ruby gems.
    :markdown
          :::bash
          gem install Cylon.js-crazyflie

    %h2 How to use
    %p
      This small program causes the Crazyflie to 'hop' up in the air for 1 second.
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'Cylon.js'

          connection :crazyflie, :adaptor => :crazyflie
          device :drone, :driver => :crazyflie, :connection => :crazyflie, :interval => 0.1

          work do
            drone.forward(0)
            drone.set_thrust_on
            after(1.seconds) {drone.stop}
          end

    %h2 How to connect
    %p
      The Crazyflie uses a 2.4 GHz radio to communicate. There is a
      USB dongle called the Crazyradio that is required to control the Crazyflie quadcopter.

      If you are have a USB 3.0 port, you might run into this issue

    %h2 How to hover
    %p
      To use Crazyflie with the hover command, requires installing the 
      %a{ href:"https://bitbucket.org/omwdunkley/crazyflie-firmware" } https://bitbucket.org/omwdunkley/crazyflie-firmware
      fork of the Crazyflie firmware. The easiest way to currently do this, is to 
      install the Crazyflie PC Client, download the 'hover' branch BIN file from here 
      %a{ href:"https://bitbucket.org/omwdunkley/crazyflie-firmware/downloads/cflie.bin" } https://bitbucket.org/omwdunkley/crazyflie-firmware/downloads/cflie.bin
      and then use the Crazyflie PC tools to update the Crazyflie firmware.

    %p
      Once you have updated the Crazyflie firmware, you will NEED to use the following syntax in your Cylon.js code to use it:

    :markdown
          :::ruby
          connection :crazyflie, :adaptor => :crazyflie, :supports_hover => true

    %p
      If you do not add :supports_hover => true to your connection code to the Crazyflie, it will go crazy out of control as you as you try to connect to it. You have been warned... 

  %section.drivers
    %h2 Drivers
    %p
      There is currently only one driver for the Crazyflie, as listed below.
