    %p
      The Digispark is an Attiny85 based microcontroller development board similar to the Arduino line, only cheaper, smaller,
      and a bit less powerful. With a whole host of shields to extend its functionality and the ability to
      use the familiar Arduino IDE the Digispark is a great way to jump into electronics, or perfect for when
      an Arduino is too big or too much.

%section.how-to#HowToInstall
  %h2 How To Install
  %p Installing gobot-digispark requires the libusb package already be installed.

  %h3 OSX
  %p To install libusb on OSX using Homebrew:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        brew install libusb

  %h3 Ubuntu
  %p To install libusb on linux:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        sudo apt-get install libusb-dev

  %p Now you can install the library with:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        go get -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-digispark

  %h2 How To Use
  %p
    This small program lets you toggle an LED on and off.
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        package main

        import (
                "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
                "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-digispark"
                "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-gpio"
        )

        func main() {

                digispark := new(gobotDigispark.DigisparkAdaptor)
                digispark.Name = "Digispark"

                led := gobotGPIO.NewLed(digispark)
                led.Name = "led"
                led.Pin = "0"

                work := func() {
                        gobot.Every("0.5s", func() {
                                led.Toggle()
                        })
                }

                robot := gobot.Robot{
                        Connections: []gobot.Connection{digispark},
                        Devices:     []gobot.Device{led},
                        Work:        work,
                }

                robot.Start()
        }

  %h2 How To Connect
  %p
    If your Digispark (
    %a{ href:"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/digispark-the-tiny-arduino-enabled-usb-dev-board"} http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/digispark-the-tiny-arduino-enabled-usb-dev-board
    ) ATTiny-based USB development board already has the Little Wire (
    %a{ href:"http://littlewire.cc/"} http://littlewire.cc/
    ) protocol firmware installed, you can connect right away with Gobot.

  %p
    Otherwise, for instructions on how to install Little Wire on a Digispark check out

        :::bash
        Important: 2012 MBP The USB ports on the 2012 MBPs (Retina and non) cause issues due to their USB3 controllers,currently the best work around is to use a cheap USB hub (non USB3) - we are working on future solutions. The hub on a Cinema display will work as well.
  %p The main steps are:
  %ul 
    %li Plug in the Digispark to the USB port
    %li Connect to the device via Gobot

  %h3 Ubuntu
  %p The main steps are:
  %ul 
    %li Add a udev rule to allow access to the Digispark device
    %li Plug in the Digispark to the USB port
    %li Connect to the device via Gobot
  %p First, you must add a udev rule, so that Gobot can communicate with the USB device. Ubuntu and other modern Linux distibutions use udev to manage device files when USB devices are added and removed. By default, udev will create a device with read-only permission which will not allow to you download code. You must place the udev rules below into a file named /etc/udev/rules.d/49-micronucleus.rules.
  :markdown
        :::bash
        # UDEV Rules for Micronucleus boards including the Digispark.
        # This file must be placed at:
        #
        # /etc/udev/rules.d/49-micronucleus.rules    (preferred location)
        #   or
        # /lib/udev/rules.d/49-micronucleus.rules    (req'd on some broken systems)
        #
        # After this file is copied, physically unplug and reconnect the board.
        #

  %p Now plug the Digispark into your computer via the USB port.

  %h2 Drivers
  %p
    Thanks to
    %b Gobot
    and
    %b go
    it is possible to interact with several I/O hardware devices and interfaces connected to the digispark
    using a set of already defined and easy to use drivers, all of this thanks to the Gobot architecture,
    in conjuction with gobot-digispark adaptor (using the littlewire communication protocol),
    which makes it even possible to swap the entire platform for something else like arduino,
    and keep using the same code you just wrote for digispark, this just by swapping a couple
    of lines in your program.
  %p
    Available drivers for the digispark platform are listed below, the drivers contain detailed documentation and examples of what kind
    physical computing (using Gobot and Go) you could be doing:
