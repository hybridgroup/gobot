          work := func() {
            gobot.On(leap.Events["Message"], func(data interface{}) {
              printHands(data.(gobotLeap.LeapFrame))
            })
          }

          robot := gobot.Robot{
            Connections: []gobot.Connection{leapAdaptor},

            Work:        work,
          }

          robot.Start()
        }
