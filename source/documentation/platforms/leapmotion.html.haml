  %h2 How To Use
  %p This small program uses a Leap Motion Adaptor.
  :markdown
        :::go
        package main

        import (
          "fmt"
          "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
          "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-leapmotion"
        )

        func main() {
          leapAdaptor := new(gobotLeap.LeapAdaptor)
          leapAdaptor.Name = "leap"
          leapAdaptor.Port = "127.0.0.1:6437"

          leap := gobotLeap.NewLeap(leapAdaptor)
          leap.Name = "leap"

          work := func() {
            gobot.On(leap.Events["Message"], func(data interface{}) {
              printHands(data.(gobotLeap.LeapFrame))
            })
          }

          robot := gobot.Robot{
            Connections: []gobot.Connection{leapAdaptor},
            Devices:     []gobot.Device{leap},
            Work:        work,
          }

          robot.Start()
        }

        func printHands(frame gobotLeap.LeapFrame) {
          for key, hand := range frame.Hands {
            fmt.Println("Hand", key, hand)
          }
