  %p In order to allow Gobot running on your Mac to access the Mindwave, go to "Bluetooth > Open Bluetooth Preferences > Sharing Setup" and make sure that "Bluetooth Sharing" is checked.

  %p Connecting to the Mindwave from Ubuntu or any other Linux-based OS can be done entirely from the command line using Gobot CLI commands. Here are the steps.

  %p Find the address of the Mindwave, by using:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        gobot scan bluetooth

  %p Pair to Mindwave using this command (substituting the actual address of your Mindwave):
  :markdown
        :::bash
        gobot bluetooth pair <address>

  %p Connect to the Mindwave using this command (substituting the actual address of your Mindwave):
  :markdown
        :::bash
        gobot bluetooth connect <address>
  

  %h3  Windows

  %p 
    :markdown
      You should be able to pair your Mindwave using your normal system tray applet for Bluetooth, and then connect to the COM port that is bound to the device, such as `COM3`.
