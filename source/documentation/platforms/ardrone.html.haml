  %h2 How To Use
  %p This small program lets the ARDrone take-off, hover, and land.

  :markdown
        :::javascript
        package main

        import (
            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-ardrone"
        )

        func main() {

            ardroneAdaptor := new(gobotArdrone.ArdroneAdaptor)
            ardroneAdaptor.Name = "Drone"

            drone := gobotArdrone.NewArdrone(ardroneAdaptor)
            drone.Name = "Drone"

            work := func() {
                drone.TakeOff()
                gobot.On(drone.Events["Flying"], func(data interface{}) {
                    gobot.After("1s", func() {
                        drone.Right(0.1)
                    })
                    gobot.After("2s", func() {
                        drone.Left(0.1)
                    })
                    gobot.After("3s", func() {
                        drone.Land()
                    })
                })
            }

            robot := gobot.Robot{
                Connections: []gobot.Connection{ardroneAdaptor},
                Devices:     []gobot.Device{drone},
                Work:        work,

            robot.Start()
        }

%section.how-to#HowToConnect
  %h2 How To Connect
  %p The ARDrone is a WiFi device, so there is no additional work to establish a connection to a single drone. However, in order to connect to multiple drones, you need to perform some configuration steps on each drone via SSH.

  -#%h2 Automatic Reset From Emergency Mode

  -#%p When you first connect to the ARDrone by calling the `start` method, if it is in "emergency" mode, the ARDrone will not take off. Gobot can automatically reset it back "normal" mode, to be able to fly IF you pass in the navigation like this example:
