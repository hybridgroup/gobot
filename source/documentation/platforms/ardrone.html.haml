  %h2 How To Use
  %p This small program lets the ARDrone take-off, hover, and land.

  :markdown
        :::go
        package main

        import (
          "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
          "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-ardrone"
        )

        func main() {

          ardroneAdaptor := new(gobotArdrone.ArdroneAdaptor)
          ardroneAdaptor.Name = "Drone"

          drone := gobotArdrone.NewArdrone(ardroneAdaptor)
          drone.Name = "Drone"

          work := func() {
            drone.TakeOff()
            gobot.On(drone.Events["Flying"], func(data interface{}) {
              gobot.After("15s", func() {
                drone.Land()
              })
            })
          }

          robot := gobot.Robot{
            Connections: []gobot.Connection{ardroneAdaptor},
            Devices:     []gobot.Device{drone},
            Work:        work,
          }

          robot.Start()
        }

%section.how-to#HowToConnect
  %h2 How To Connect
  %p The ARDrone is a WiFi device, so there is no additional work to establish a connection to a single drone. However, in order to connect to multiple drones, you need to perform some configuration steps on each drone via SSH.

  %h2 Automatic Reset From Emergency Mode

  %p Gobot will automatically reset the emergency mode back to the "normal" state on TakeOff
