  %h2 How to install
  %p
    Installing gobot with pebble support is pretty easy using ruby gems.
  :markdown
        :::bash
        gem install gobot-pebble
  %h2 How to use
  %p
    This small program receives button press events from a Pebble smart watch.
  :markdown
        :::go
        require 'gobot'

        connection :pebble, :adaptor => :pebble, :port => "/dev/rfcomm0", :id => "378B"
        device :watch, :driver => :pebble

        work do
          on watch, :media_control => :button_push
        end

        def button_push(caller, data)
          puts data.button unless data.nil?
        end
  %h2 How to connect
  %p This software requires version 1.12.0 of the Pebble watch firmware.

  %h3 OSX

  %p The main steps are:

  %ul
    %li Pair your computer and the Pebble
    %li Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local port
    %li Connect to the device via gobot
    %li To figure out which port your pebble is connected to, use the gobot connect scan command:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ gobot connect scan

  %p Now you are ready to connect to the Sphero using the socket, in this example port 4567:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        gobot connect serial 4567 pebble

  %h3 Ubuntu

  %p The main steps are:

  %ul
    %li Pair your computer and the Pebble
    %li Map your device to a port
    %li Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local port
    %li Connect to the device via gobot
    %li You will need to pair with the Pebble, entering any needed password.

  %p Then you can find the Bluetooth address, for example 00:18:33:86:37:8B, by using the gobot connect scan command:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ gobot connect scan

  %p Once you know the address, you can use the gobot connect bind command to map a port to the device:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        gobot connect bind 00:18:33:86:37:8B pebble

  %p Now you are ready to connect to the Pebble using a socket, in this example port 4567:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        gobot connect socat pebble 4567
