  %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
  :markdown
        :::go
        require 'gobot'
        connection :joystick, :adaptor => :joystick
        device :controller, :driver => :joystick, :connection => :joystick, :interval => 0.1

%section.public-events
  %h2 Public driver events
  %h3 joystick
  %p Get's triggered every "interval" amount of time if a joystick event occured, you can access values x, y, s.

  %h3 button
  %p Get's triggered every "interval" amount of time if the button was pressed, you can access the value of the pressed button.

  %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
  %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        on joystick, :joystick => proc { |caller, value|
          puts 'joystick ' + value[:s].to_s, value[:x], value[:y]
        }

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'gobot'

        connection :joystick, :adaptor => :joystick
        device :joystick, :driver => :joystick, :connection => :joystick, :interval => 0.1

        work do
          on joystick, :joystick => proc { |caller, value|
            puts 'joystick ' + value[:s].to_s, value[:x], value[:y]
          }
          on joystick, :button => proc { |*value|
            puts 'button ' + value[1]
          }
        end
