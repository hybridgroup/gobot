    %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'Cylon.js'
          connection :joystick, :adaptor => :joystick
          device :controller, :driver => :joystick, :connection => :joystick, :interval => 0.1

  %section.public-events
    %h2 Public driver events
    %h3 joystick
    %p Get's triggered every "interval" amount of time if a joystick event occured, you can access values x, y, s.

    %h3 button
    %p Get's triggered every "interval" amount of time if the button was pressed, you can access the value of the pressed button.

    %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
    %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          on joystick, :joystick => proc { |caller, value|
            puts 'joystick ' + value[:s].to_s, value[:x], value[:y]
          }

    %h3 Example receiving button events from a generic joystick.
    :markdown
          :::ruby
          require 'Cylon.js'

          connection :joystick, :adaptor => :joystick
          device :joystick, :driver => :joystick, :connection => :joystick, :interval => 0.1

          work do
            on joystick, :joystick => proc { |caller, value|
              puts 'joystick ' + value[:s].to_s, value[:x], value[:y]
            }
            on joystick, :button => proc { |*value|
              puts 'button ' + value[1]
            }
          end
