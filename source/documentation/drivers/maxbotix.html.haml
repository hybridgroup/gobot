%section.public-methods
  %h2 Commands:

  %h3 range → distance_in_inches(float)
  %p
    Returns the distance measured by the sonar in inches.

  %h3 range_cm → distance_in_cm(float)
  %p
    Returns the distance measured by the sonar in cm.

%section.public-events
  %h2 Events:
  %p
    The events will be triggered when the amount of time specified by the param :interval, when setting up the driver, passes.
  %h3 :range
  %p
    Gets triggered after :interval amount of time passes, everytime the range will be read and the event triggered.

  %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
  %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
