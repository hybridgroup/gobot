# Sphero SPRK+

The Sphero SPRK+ is a toy robot from Sphero that is controlled using Bluetooth LE. For more information, go to [http://www.sphero.com/sprk-plus](http://www.sphero.com/sprk-plus)

## How to Install

```
go get -d -u gobot.io/x/gobot/v2/...
```

## How to Use

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"time"

	"gobot.io/x/gobot/v2"
	"gobot.io/x/gobot/v2/platforms/ble"
	"gobot.io/x/gobot/v2/platforms/sphero/sprkplus"
)

func main() {
	bleAdaptor := ble.NewClientAdaptor(os.Args[1])
	sprk := sprkplus.NewDriver(bleAdaptor)

	work := func() {
		gobot.Every(1*time.Second, func() {
			r := uint8(gobot.Rand(255))
			g := uint8(gobot.Rand(255))
			b := uint8(gobot.Rand(255))
			sprk.SetRGB(r, g, b)
		})
	}

	robot := gobot.NewRobot("sprk",
		[]gobot.Connection{bleAdaptor},
		[]gobot.Device{sprk},
		work,
	)

	robot.Start()
}
```

## How to Connect

The Sphero SPRK+ is a Bluetooth LE device.

You need to know the BLE ID of the SPRK+ you want to connect to. The Gobot BLE client adaptor also lets you connect by friendly name, aka "SK-1247".

### OSX

To run any of the Gobot BLE code you must use the `GODEBUG=cgocheck=0` flag in order to get around some of the issues in the CGo-based implementation.

If you connect by name, then you do not need to worry about the Bluetooth LE ID. However, if you want to connect by ID, OS X uses its own Bluetooth ID system which is different from the IDs used on Linux. The code calls thru the XPC interfaces provided by OSX, so as a result does not need to run under sudo.

For example:

    GODEBUG=cgocheck=0 go run examples/sprkplus.go SK-1247

### Ubuntu

On Linux the BLE code will need to run as a root user account. The easiest way to accomplish this is probably to use `go build` to build your program, and then to run the requesting executable using `sudo`.

For example:

    go build examples/sprkplus.go
    sudo ./sprkplus SK-1247

### Windows

Hopefully coming soon...
