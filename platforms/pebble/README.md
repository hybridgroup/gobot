# Pebble

This repository contains the Gobot adaptor for [Pebble smart watch](http://getpebble.com/).

It uses the Pebble 2.0 SDK, and requires the 2.0 iOS or Android app, and that the ["watchbot" app](https://gobot.io/x/watchbot)
has been installed on the Pebble watch.

## How to Install

Please refer to the main [README.md](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/blob/release/README.md)

* Install Pebble 2.0 iOS or Android app. (If you haven't already)
* Follow README to install and configure "watchbot" on your watch: <https://gobot.io/x/watchbot>

## How to Use

Before running the example, make sure configuration settings match with your program. In the example, api host is your
computer IP, robot name is 'pebble' and robot api port is 8080

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"

  "gobot.io/x/gobot/v2"
  "gobot.io/x/gobot/v2/api"
  "gobot.io/x/gobot/v2/platforms/pebble"
)

func main() {
  master := gobot.NewMaster()
  api.NewAPI(master).Start()

  pebbleAdaptor := pebble.NewAdaptor()
  watch := pebble.NewDriver(pebbleAdaptor)

  work := func() {
    watch.SendNotification("Hello Pebble!")
    watch.On(watch.Event("button"), func(data interface{}) {
      fmt.Println("Button pushed: " + data.(string))
    })

    watch.On(watch.Event("tap"), func(data interface{}) {
      fmt.Println("Tap event detected")
    })
  }

  robot := gobot.NewRobot("pebble",
    []gobot.Connection{pebbleAdaptor},
    []gobot.Device{watch},
    work,
  )

  master.AddRobot(robot)

  if err := master.Start(); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

```
