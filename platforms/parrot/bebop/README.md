# Bebop

The Parrot Bebop and Parrot Bebop 2 are inexpensive quadcopters that can be controlled using their built-in API commands
via a WiFi connection. They include a built-in front-facing HD video camera, as well as a second lower resolution
bottom-facing video camera.

## How to Install

Please refer to the main [README.md](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/blob/release/README.md)

## How to Use

```go
package main

import (
  "time"

  "gobot.io/x/gobot/v2"
  "gobot.io/x/gobot/v2/platforms/parrot/bebop"
)

func main() {
  bebopAdaptor := bebop.NewAdaptor()
  drone := bebop.NewDriver(bebopAdaptor)

  work := func() {
    drone.HullProtection(true)
    drone.TakeOff()
    gobot.On(drone.Event("flying"), func(data interface{}) {
      gobot.After(3*time.Second, func() {
        drone.Land()
      })
    })
  }

  robot := gobot.NewRobot("drone",
    []gobot.Connection{bebopAdaptor},
    []gobot.Device{drone},
    work,
  )

  robot.Start()
}
```

## How to Connect

By default, the Parrot Bebop is a WiFi access point, so there is no additional work to establish a connection to a single
drone, you just connect to it.

Once connected, if you want to stream drone video you can either:

- Use the RTP protocol with an external player such as mplayer or VLC.
- Grab the video frames from the drone's data frames, and work with them directly.
