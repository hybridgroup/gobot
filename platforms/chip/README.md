# C.H.I.P.

The [C.H.I.P.](http://www.getchip.com/) is a small, inexpensive ARM based single board computer, with many different IO
interfaces available on the [pin headers](http://docs.getchip.com/#pin-headers).

For documentation about the C.H.I.P. platform click [here](http://docs.getchip.com/).

The [C.H.I.P. Pro](https://getchip.com/pages/chippro) is a version of C.H.I.P. intended for use in embedded product
development. Here is info about the [C.H.I.P. Pro pin headers](https://docs.getchip.com/chip_pro.html#pin-descriptions).

## How to Install

We recommend updating to the latest Debian OS when using the C.H.I.P., however Gobot should also support older versions
of the OS, should your application require this.

You would normally install Go and Gobot on your workstation. Once installed, cross compile your program on your
workstation, transfer the final executable to your C.H.I.P and run the program on the C.H.I.P. itself as documented here.

Please refer to the main [README.md](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/blob/release/README.md)

### PWM support

Note that PWM might not be available in your kernel. In that case, you can install the required device tree overlay
from the command line using [Gort](https://gobot.io/x/gort) CLI commands on the C.H.I.P device.
Here are the steps:

Install the required patched device tree compiler as described in the [C.H.I.P docs](https://docs.getchip.com/dip.html#make-a-dtbo-device-tree-overlay-blob):

```sh
gort chip install dtc
```

Now, install the pwm overlay to activate pwm on the PWM0 pin:

```sh
gort chip install pwm
```

Reboot the device to make sure the init script loads the overlay on boot.

## How to Use

Please refer to one example for your platform, e.g. [chip_button.go](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/blob/release/examples/chip_button.go).
The pin numbering used by your Gobot program should match the way your board is labeled right on the board itself.
If you want to use the C.H.I.P. Pro, use the `NewProAdaptor()` function like this:

```go
chipProAdaptor := chip.NewProAdaptor()
```

## How to Connect

### Compiling

Compile your Gobot program on your workstation like this:

```bash
GOARM=7 GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux go build examples/chip_button.go
```

Once you have compiled your code, you can you can upload your program and execute it on the C.H.I.P. from your workstation
using the `scp` and `ssh` commands like this:

```bash
scp chip_button root@192.168.1.xx:
ssh -t root@192.168.1.xx "./chip_button"
```
