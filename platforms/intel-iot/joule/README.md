The Intel Joule is a WiFi and Bluetooth enabled development platform for the Internet of Things.

For more info about the Intel Joule platform go to:

<http://www.intel.com/joule>

## How to Install

Please refer to the main [README.md](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/blob/release/README.md)

### Setting up your Intel Joule

Everything you need to get started with the Joule is in the Intel Getting Started Guide located at:

<https://intel.com/joule/getstarted>

Don't forget to configure your Joule's WiFi connection and update your Joule to the latest firmware image. Gobot has been
tested using the reference OS based on Ostro.

## How To Use

```go
package main

import (
  "time"

  "gobot.io/x/gobot/v2"
  "gobot.io/x/gobot/v2/drivers/gpio"
  "gobot.io/x/gobot/v2/platforms/intel-iot/joule"
)

func main() {
  e := joule.NewAdaptor()
  led := gpio.NewLedDriver(e, "GP103")

  work := func() {
    gobot.Every(1*time.Second, func() {
      led.Toggle()
    })
  }

  robot := gobot.NewRobot("blinkBot",
    []gobot.Connection{e},
    []gobot.Device{led},
    work,
  )

  robot.Start()
}
```

You can read the [full API documentation online](http://godoc.org/gobot.io/x/gobot/v2).

## How to Connect

### Compiling

Compile your Gobot program on your workstation like this:

```sh
GOARCH=386 GOOS=linux go build joule_blink.go
```

Once you have compiled your code, you can you can upload your program and execute it on the Intel Joule from your workstation
using the `scp` and `ssh` commands like this:

```sh
scp joule_blink root@<IP of your device>:/home/root/
ssh -t root@<IP of your device> "./joule_blink"
```

At this point you should see one of the onboard LEDs blinking. Press control + c
to exit.

To update the program after you made a change, you will need to scp it
over once again and start it from the command line (via screen).

## Pin Mapping

The Gobot pin mapping for the Intel Joule uses a naming system based on how the pins are labeled on the board itself.

There are 2 jumpers on the Joule expansion board, labeled "J12" and "J13". There are 2 rows of pins on each jumper, labeled
from 1 to 40. So to use the 26th pin of jumper J12, you use pin name "J12_26".

In addition, there are pins that control the build-in LEDs (pins GP100 thru GP103) as used in the example above.

The i2c interfaces on the Intel Joule developer kit board require that you terminate the SDA & SCL lines using 2 10K resistors
pulled up to the voltage used for the i2c device, for example 5V.
