# Raspi

The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive and popular ARM based single board computer with digital & PWM GPIO, and i2c interfaces built in.

The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card-sized single-board computer developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools

## How to Install

First you must install the appropriate Go packages

```
go get -d -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/... && go install github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/raspi
```

### Special note for Raspian Wheezy users

The go vesion installed from the default package repositories is very old and will not compile gobot. You can install go 1.4 as follows:

```bash
$ wget -O - http://dave.cheney.net/paste/go1.4.linux-arm~multiarch-armv6-1.tar.gz|sudo tar -xzC /usr/local -f -

$ echo '# Setup for golang' |sudo tee /etc/profile.d/golang.sh
$ echo 'PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin'|sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/golang.sh

$ source /etc/profile.d/golang.sh
```

#### Cross compiling for the Raspberry Pi
You must first configure your Go environment for linux cross compiling

```bash
$ cd $GOROOT/src
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm ./make.bash --no-clean

```

Then compile your Gobot program with

```bash
$ GOARM=6 GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux examples/raspi_blink.go
```

Then you can simply upload your program over the network from your host computer to the Raspi

```bash
$ scp raspi_blink pi@192.168.1.xxx:/home/pi/
```

and execute it on your Raspberry Pi with

```bash
$ ./raspi_blink
```

## How to Use

```go
package main

import (
        "time"

        "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
        "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/gpio"
        "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/raspi"
)

func main() {
        gbot := gobot.NewGobot()

        r := raspi.NewRaspiAdaptor("raspi")
        led := gpio.NewLedDriver(r, "led", "7")

        work := func() {
                gobot.Every(1*time.Second, func() {
                        led.Toggle()
                })
        }

        robot := gobot.NewRobot("blinkBot",
                []gobot.Connection{r},
                []gobot.Device{led},
                work,
        )

        gbot.AddRobot(robot)

        gbot.Start()
}
```
