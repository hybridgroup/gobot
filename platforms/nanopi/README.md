# NanoPi Boards

The FriendlyARM NanoPi Boards are single board SoC computers with different hardware design. It has built-in GPIO, PWM,
SPI, and I2C interfaces.

For more info about the NanoPi Boards, go to [https://wiki.friendlyelec.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page](https://wiki.friendlyelec.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).

## How to Install

Tested OS:

* [armbian](https://www.armbian.com/nanopi-neo/) with Debian or Ubuntu

You would normally install Go and Gobot on your workstation. Once installed, cross compile your program on your
workstation, transfer the final executable to your board, and run the program on the board as documented here.

```sh
go get -d -u gobot.io/x/gobot/v2/...
```

### System access and configuration basics

Please follow the installation instructions for the chosen OS.

### Enabling hardware drivers

Please follow the configuration instructions for the chosen OS.

E.g. for armbian:

```sh
sudo armbian-config
```

After configuration was changed, an reboot is necessary.

```sh
sudo reboot
```

## How to Use

The pin numbering used by your Gobot program should match the way your board is labeled right on the board itself.

```go
r := nanopi.NewNeoAdaptor()
led := gpio.NewLedDriver(r, "7")
```

## How to Connect

### Compiling

Compile your Gobot program on your workstation like this:

```sh
GOARM=7 GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux go build examples/nanopi_blink.go
```

Once you have compiled your code, you can upload your program and execute it on the board from your workstation
using the `scp` and `ssh` commands like this:

```sh
scp nanopi_blink nan@nanopineo:~
ssh -t nan@nanopineo "./nanopi_blink"
```

## GPIO's

At least for NEO, nearly all 14 GPIO's supports the advanced pin options "bias", "drive", "debounce" and "edge detection".

> Configure of edge detection will cause an initial event. GPIO header pins 19, 21, 23, 24 - do NOT support "debounce" and
> "edge detection" for NEO. Using unsupported options leads to reconfigure errors with text "no such device or address".

## PWM

A single PWM output is available at UART0-RX (UART_RXD0, internal PA5). So the UART0 needs to be disabled. The sunxi-
overlay (e.g. for armbian) disables the UART0 and the kernel console at ttyS0. The related kernel module needs to be
loaded: `sudo modprobe pwm-sun4i`. The default frequency is 100Hz.

## I2C

The default bus number is set to 0, which is connected to header pins 3 (PA12-SDA) and 5 (PA11-SCL). At least for NEO
rev.1.4 it is possible to activate bus 1, which is connected to "USB/Audio/IR" header pins 9 "PCM0_CLK/I2S0_BCK"
(PA19-SDA) and 8 "PCM0_SYNC/I2S0_LRC" (PA18-SCL). Armbian allows to activate bus 2 (PE12-SCL, PE13-SDA), which pins are
not wired for NEO and NEO2, but we do not block it at adaptor side.

## SPI

There is a known issue on [armbian](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/20033-51525-breaks-spi-on-nanopi-neo-and-does-not-create-devspidev00/)
for later Kernels.
