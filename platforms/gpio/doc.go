/*
This package provides drivers for General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output) devices . It is normally not used directly, but instead is registered by an adaptor such as firmata (https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/firmata) that supports the needed interfaces for GPIO devices.

Installing:

	go get github.com/hybridgroup/gobot && go install github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/gpio

For further information refer to gpio README:
