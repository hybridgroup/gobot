# GPIO

This package provides drivers for [General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output)
devices. It is normally used by connecting an adaptor such as [Raspberry Pi](https://gobot.io/documentation/platforms/raspi/)
that supports the needed interfaces for GPIO devices.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the main [README.md](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/blob/release/README.md)
