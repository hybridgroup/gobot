# GPIO

This package provides drivers for [General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output) devices. It is normally used by connecting an adaptor such as [firmata](https://gobot.io/x/gobot/platforms/firmata) that supports the needed interfaces for GPIO devices.
