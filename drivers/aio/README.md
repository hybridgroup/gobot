# AIO

This package provides drivers for [Analog Input/Output (AIO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter)
devices. It is normally used by connecting an adaptor such as [BeagleBone](https://gobot.io/documentation/platforms/beaglebone/)
that supports the needed interfaces for analog devices.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the main [README.md](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/blob/release/README.md)
