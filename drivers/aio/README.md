# AIO

This package provides drivers for [Analog Input/Output (AIO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter) devices. It is normally used by connecting an adaptor such as [firmata](https://gobot.io/x/gobot/platforms/firmata) that supports the needed interfaces for analog devices.

## Getting Started

## Installing
```
go get -d -u gobot.io/x/gobot/...
```

## Hardware Support
Gobot has a extensible system for connecting to hardware devices. The following AIO devices are currently supported:
  - Analog Sensor
  - Grove Light Sensor
  - Grove Rotary Dial
  - Grove Sound Sensor
  - Grove Temperature Sensor

More drivers are coming soon...
