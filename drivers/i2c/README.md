# I2C

This package provides drivers for [i2c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)devices. It must be used along with an adaptor such as [firmata](https://gobot.io/x/gobot/platforms/firmata) that supports the needed interfaces for i2c devices.

## Getting Started

## Installing
```
go get -d -u gobot.io/x/gobot/...
```

## Using A Different Bus or Address

You can set a different I2C address or I2C bus than the default when initializing your I2C drivers by using optional parameters. Here is an example:

```go
blinkm := i2c.NewBlinkMDriver(e, i2c.WithBus(0), i2c.WithAddress(0x09))
```
