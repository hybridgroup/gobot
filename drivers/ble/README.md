# BLE

This package provides drivers for [Bluetooth LE (BLE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy)
devices. It is normally used by connecting an [BLE client adaptor](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/tree/release/platforms/bleclient)
that supports the needed interfaces for BLE devices.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the main [README.md](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/blob/release/README.md) and the README files
in the subfolders.
